# Social media editorial guidelines

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to establish clear guidelines to maintain a consistent voice for the conference across social media and multiple authors.

Open Source & Feelings wants to build a broad coalition of viewpoints and talents together to work to make Open Source a better learning and working community. The voice of OS&F is positive, thankful, kind, inclusive, and welcoming.

This document extends to all social media produced by OS&F including our website, Twitter, and our newsletter.

## General guidelines

http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/legal/intel-social-media-guidelines.html

- Use Open Source & Feelings instead of OS&F the first time you use the name of the conference, except when space does not allow the full name.
- Always use an ampersand in the conference name. Prefer an ampersand in sentence fragments. Prefer "and" in complete sentences, especially when conjoining sentences.

> Ampersand in a sentence fragment:
> Where & When
>
> And in a sentence:
> Open Source culture, left to grow untended, has been co-opted, diluted, and leaves too many individuals behind.

- Use the first person plural, that is, use "we," NOT "I," unless you are putting your name on what you are writing.
- Because we have a casual and positive voice, exclamation points and ✨emoji✨ are recommended. Avoid semicolons, however.
- Avoid sentences with more than one conjunction.
- Never publish other's information or photo without their permission.

## Checklist and guidelines for tweeting as [@osfeels](https://twitter.com/osfeels)

- [ ] Read the tweet backwards to detect misspelled words.
- [ ] Spend three minutes catching up on [the news](http://news.google.com). Reread the tweet. Does it inadvertently reference a story in the news?
- [ ] Confirm that the tweet is written in the first person plural, that is, use "we," NOT "I."
- [ ] Is the tweet positive, thankful, kind, inclusive, and welcoming? If not shelve it.

- Does the tweet need a few emoji?

It is recommended that you respond to tweets to @osfeels as soon as possible. However, underpromise and overdeliver. If someone asks something of @osfeels, either confirm that we can meet their request before telling them it is possible, or tell them that you will investigate it.

It is recommended that you use a service like buffer.com to stagger retweets as they do not need to be posted immediately.
