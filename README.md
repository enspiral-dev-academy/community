# OS&F

## ~~Purpose~~ Mission

@jnf's draft: OS&F is a two-day event in which we explore the Humanities & Arts through the lens of technology, those tools and products that allow us to richly experience and interact with each other, our communities, and the world.

@strand's freewrite: Open Source and Feelings is a community-driven event to connect open source maintainers and contributors to conversations around empathy, teambuilding, and kindness.

A two day event which provides beginners and experts with a chance to connect with others, find projects to improve

Community

OS&F is about educating old hats on empathy and greenhorns on making meaningful contributions.

OS&F is a physical meetup for a distributed community.

At its heart open source is about sharing your ideas with the world. OS is inherently kind. This is the soul of it.

What are the verbs, what are the nouns?

OS&F is dedicated to connecting the technical community and the empathy community.

technical and soulful
this event is focused on generosity of spirit.

## Essays(?) worth writing

- Open source is (should be?) kind.
- The value of meatspace.
- Balancing soulful and technical
