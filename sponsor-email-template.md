`company name` sponsorship of Open Source & Feelings 2015?

### Email body
Hey `contact's first name`,

Open Source & Feelings (OS&F) is a two-day event exploring the Humanities & Arts through the lens of open source technology. This is the first attempt to bring a conference of this kind to Seattle, and we are hoping `company` would be interested in helping make this even possible.

OS&F is lining up sponsors for an October event (exact date TBD). Around 200 software engineering and information technology professionals, community organizers, and industry representatives will come together to discuss and learn about technological and cultural concerns in open source communities.

Attached is our current sponsorship prospectus and informational letter. We are still early in the event planning, so some information is yet to be determined or is likely to change. Please note that these spots are first come first serve, so it’s important to get back to us as soon as possible to secure your sponsorship position.

Let me know if you have any questions. We hope you’ll sponsor this year!

Thank you so much,

`your name`
`your os&f email`
