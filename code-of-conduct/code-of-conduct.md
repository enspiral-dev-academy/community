### Long version

#### Purpose

A primary goal of Open Source and Feelings is to be safe, inclusive, and welcoming to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, socioeconomic status, race, age, or religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in Open Source and Feelings to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

#### Open Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is safe, welcoming, inclusive friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

_**We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and conference-related social events.**_

### Internal version

#### Warnings

Any member of conference staff can issue a verbal warning to a participant that their behavior violates the conference's Code of Conduct. Warnings should be reported to conduct@opensourceandfeelings.com as soon as practical. The report should include:

 - Identifying information (name/badge number) of the participant
 - The time you issued the warning
 - The behavior that was in violation
 - The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time of warning)
 - The circumstances surrounding the incident
 - Your identity
 - Other people involved in the incident

#### Presentations

Presentations or similar events should not be stopped for one-time gaffes or minor problems, although a member of conference staff should speak to the presenter afterward. However, staff should take immediate action to politely and calmly stop any presentation or event that repeatedly or seriously violates the Code of Conduct. For example, simply say "I'm sorry, this presentation cannot be continued at the present time" with no further explanation.

#### Taking reports

When taking a report from someone experiencing harassment you should record what they say and reassure them they are being taken seriously, but avoid making specific promises about what actions the organizers will take. Ask for any other information if the reporter has not volunteered it (such as time, place) but do not pressure them to provide it if they are reluctant. **Even if the report lacks important details such as the identity of the person taking the harassing actions, it should still be recorded and passed along to the appropriate staff members.**

If the reporter desires it, arrange for an escort by conference staff or a trusted person, contact a friend, and contact local law enforcement. Do not pressure the reporter to take any action if they do not want to do it. Respect the reporter's privacy by not sharing unnecessary details with others, especially individuals who were not involved with the situation or non-staff members. The report should include:

 - Identifying information (name/badge number) of the participant
 - The time you issued the warning
 - The behavior that was in violation
 - The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time of warning)
 - The circumstances surrounding the incident
 - Your identity
 - Other people involved in the incident

#### Expulsion

A participant may be expelled by the decision of organizers for whatever reasons they deem sufficient. However, here are some general guidelines for when a participant should be expelled:

 - A single serious offense (e.g., punching or groping someone)
 - A single obviously intentional offense (e.g., taking photos without permission)
 - A second offense resulting in a warning from staff
 - Continuing to harass after any "No" or "Stop" instruction
 - A pattern of harassing behavior, with or without warnings

Security and local authorities should be contacted when appropriate.

#### Public statements

As a general rule, conference staff should not make any public statements about the behavior of individual people during or after the conference.

In general, consult with other staff members when possible but act when necessary.
