### Long version

#### Code of Conduct

All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at Open Source & Feelings are required to abide by the code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everyone.

Open Source & Feelings is dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, harassment-free conference experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.

Harassment includes:

 - verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, and religion (or lack thereof)
 - sexual images in public spaces
 - deliberate intimidation
 - stalking and following
 - harassing photography or recording
 - sustained disruption of talks or other events
 - inappropriate physical contact
 - unwelcome sexual attention

No weapons of any kind, alcohol, or drugs are allowed at AlterConf venues.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are subject to the Code of Conduct. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff, including volunteers, should not wear sexualized clothing, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately.

Conference staff can be identified by their [TKTKTK color] t-shirts.

Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

### Internal version

#### Warnings

Any member of conference staff can issue a verbal warning to a participant that their behavior violates the conference's Code of Conduct. Warnings should be reported to conduct@opensourceandfeelings.com as soon as practical. The report should include:

 - Identifying information (name/badge number) of the participant
 - The time you issued the warning
 - The behavior that was in violation
 - The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time of warning)
 - The circumstances surrounding the incident
 - Your identity
 - Other people involved in the incident

#### Presentations

Presentations or similar events should not be stopped for one-time gaffes or minor problems, although a member of conference staff should speak to the presenter afterward. However, staff should take immediate action to politely and calmly stop any presentation or event that repeatedly or seriously violates the Code of Conduct. For example, simply say "I'm sorry, this presentation cannot be continued at the present time" with no further explanation.

#### Taking reports

When taking a report from someone experiencing harassment you should record what they say and reassure them they are being taken seriously, but avoid making specific promises about what actions the organizers will take. Ask for any other information if the reporter has not volunteered it (such as time, place) but do not pressure them to provide it if they are reluctant. **Even if the report lacks important details such as the identity of the person taking the harassing actions, it should still be recorded and passed along to the appropriate staff members.**

If the reporter desires it, arrange for an escort by conference staff or a trusted person, contact a friend, and contact local law enforcement. Do not pressure the reporter to take any action if they do not want to do it. Respect the reporter's privacy by not sharing unnecessary details with others, especially individuals who were not involved with the situation or non-staff members. The report should include:

 - Identifying information (name/badge number) of the participant
 - The time you issued the warning
 - The behavior that was in violation
 - The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time of warning)
 - The circumstances surrounding the incident
 - Your identity
 - Other people involved in the incident

#### Expulsion

A participant may be expelled by the decision of organizers for whatever reasons they deem sufficient. However, here are some general guidelines for when a participant should be expelled:

 - A single serious offense (e.g., punching or groping someone)
 - A single obviously intentional offense (e.g., taking photos without permission)
 - A second offense resulting in a warning from staff
 - Continuing to harass after any "No" or "Stop" instruction
 - A pattern of harassing behavior, with or without warnings

Security and local authorities should be contacted when appropriate.

 - [TKTKTK Local taxi company]

#### Public statements

As a general rule, conference staff should not make any public statements about the behavior of individual people during or after the conference.

In general, consult with other staff members when possible but act when necessary.
