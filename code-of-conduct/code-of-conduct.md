# Code of Conduct.

The Open Source & Feelings code of conduct is based on the [Geek Feminism Conference Anti-Harassment Policy](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy), the [Alterconf Code of Conduct](http://www.alterconf.com/code-of-conduct), and the [Stumptown Syndicate Citizen Code of Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/). See [License and Attribution](license-and-attribution) for more details.

There are two versions:

- The [short version](short.md) is ideal for including with our email newsletter.
- The [long version](long.md) is suitable for the website and specifies the nuts and bolts of the policy.

Additionally, we have an [enforcement policy](enforcement.md) for conference organizers.
